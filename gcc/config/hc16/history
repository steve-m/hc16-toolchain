			XGCC for 68HC16
			---------------

HC16.4 -- 1996 September 18
---------------------------
	Derived from HC11.36, converted to 68HC16:
	- Added new HC16 registers.
	- Generates thunk routines for each function in the const section 
	  to allow word function pointers.
	- Converted to use SI mode directly in registers.
	- Updated instruction lengths.
	- Uses expanding multiply instructions.
	- All adds to index registers go through an accumulator.  This
	  avoids corruption of the extension registers by the normal
	  ai[xyzs] # and a[de][xyz] instructions.
	- Assumes and maintains sk = ek = xk = yk = zk.  If access to i/o
	  registers is required, these must be set to 0Fh.
	- All constant data stored in idata section, which must be
	  linked to match sk, ek, xk, yk and zk.


HC16.5 -- 1996 October 2
------------------------
	Local constant names now incorporate the source file name, and
	generate separate modules when compiled with the -mpak switch.


HC16.6 -- 1996 November 14
--------------------------
	Added code generation for single floats.


HC16.7 -- 1997 February 4
-------------------------
	Patched around bug in 2500AD rev 4.05e assembler where the aix #,
	aiy #, aiz #, ais #, addd #, and adde # instructions generate 
	incorrect code for constants in the range of 128 to 255.  Requires
	aix, aiy, aiz, ais macros in std.mac.  Also requires aid and aie
	macros which are generated by the compiler to replace addd # and
	adde #.

	Modified hc16.h to always place a '+' after the '#' in immediate
	addressing mode.  This is required to support the aix...aie macros.

	Changed some insns to use xgd? instead of xge? to shorten binary.

	Fixed cmpqi d,e insn to generate correct code rather than an illop
	trap.

	Fixed problem in subhi3/4 alternative in which no code at all was
	generated.

	FIXME:  cmpsi does not handle low word properly


HC16.8 -- 1998 July 9
----------------------
	Took off all of patches for 2500AD. Compiled and tested.  It works
	with GNU assembler and linker.


HC16.9 -- 1998 July 14
----------------------
	Convert to build and host under Linux.
